# Configuration
# -------------

# The full class name of the Database Configuration class. This determines the default DB connector which is used for storing the models:
dbConfig.className=com.datumbox.framework.common.persistentstorage.mapdb.MapDBConfiguration


# InMemoryConfiguration
# ---------------------

# The relative or absolute path for the output folder where the models are stored (if not specified the temporary folder is used):
dbConfig.InMemoryConfiguration.outputFolder=


# MapDBConfiguration
# ------------------

# The relative or absolute path for the output folder where the models are stored (if not specified the temporary folder is used):
dbConfig.MapDBConfiguration.outputFolder=

# The number of records kept in each LRU cache. Setting it to 0 will disable caching (not recommended):
dbConfig.MapDBConfiguration.cacheSize=0

# Whether compression will be used in storage (options: true/false):
dbConfig.MapDBConfiguration.compressed=true

# The hybridized mode enables small and important data to be stored directly In-Memory (options: true/false):
dbConfig.MapDBConfiguration.hybridized=false


# ConcurrencyConfiguration
# ------------------------

# Whether the concurrent execution of tasks is allowed (options: true/false):
concurrencyConfig.parallelized=true

# The maximum number of Threads that can be executed concurrently for each task: 
#   - Use 0 for setting it equal to the number of CPUs on the system.
#   - Use 1 to turn off concurrency (same as concurrencyConfig.parallelized=false).
#   - Any other positive value acts as a limit on the concurrency level, provided that the concurrencyConfig.parallelized=true.
concurrencyConfig.maxNumberOfThreadsPerTask=0
